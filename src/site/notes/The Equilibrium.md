Comprised of [[The Shining Light\|The Shining Light]] and [[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]].

The Equilibrium, a combined God that no longer exists. When [[The Shining Light\|The Shining Light]] and [[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]] cooperate with each other, they form the Supreme God. This God embodies the balance of the Universe itself. It is the closest creature to being the Omnipotent. 

However, if [[The Shining Light\|The Shining Light]] or [[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]] are not in balance, this God's form shatters, and it will split once more. Since [[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]] has been imprisoned deep within [[The Shadowfell\|The Shadowfell]], this God shall not reemerge for some time.
