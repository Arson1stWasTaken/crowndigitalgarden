[[The Gods\|The God]] of Death. Very few worship him. The religion is stern, emotionless, and pitiless, as are his Clerics. Many who follow him believe that fate is not to be argued with, and your life is determined from beginning to the bitter end. The Clerics of his domain dare not to encourage or speed up death, as they believe it is a sacred process, and to interfere is to blaspheme. His Clerics patiently await their end while encouraging others to do the same. 

More sinister Clerics of [[The Inevitable\|The Inevitable]] sacrifice others to grow the power of their God. They see these moments as opportunities to make peace with their own demise and witness their Lord at work. Others seek Eternal Life in the form of Undeath. They see it as the perfect form of existence, a divine gift granted to them by [[The Inevitable\|The Inevitable]].
