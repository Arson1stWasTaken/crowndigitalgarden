An endless bloodlust. The Relentless granted what he perceived as a "gift" to man. Pain. Without pain, life is purposeless to him.

The look of agony when you stab someone in battle. The tears that well in one's eyes when they bleed. These are priceless to him. Yet, the Relentless also wishes to see mortals rise above pain. Courage, Endurance, STRENGTH. 

The Relentless held a contest. He disguised himself as a young warrior. He said that if his opponent could endure the unimaginable pain he would inflict upon them with his Dagger of Torment for even 3 seconds, he'd grant them great riches.

Man after man failed, but a young woman, Rin Melkar, showed herself before the God. She accepted the slash, and she was in agonizing pain. But she had endured the 3 seconds. Such, the Relentless showed his true form. He granted her bloodline extraordinary power, and that should they be wronged, he would see to their retribution.

As such, when the Melkar bloodline was decimated by the [[Order of Eternal Light\|Order]], the Relentless empowered [[Razmyrel Melkar\|Razymrel]] with great power to smite down their theocracy as divine vengeance.
