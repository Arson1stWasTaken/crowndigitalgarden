The Wise One is a being which seeks knowledge no matter the cost. It is the closest creature to being Omniscient. It granted mortals the gift of sentience and intelligence.

After the fall of [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]], the Wise One was intrigued about its powers. It ventured to its prison, and inquired about its methods. [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]] humored the Wise One, and gave it a well of forbidden knowledge.

The Wise One gathered all of this forbidden knowledge into a forbidden tome known as the Tome of the Lost. However, [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]] was much more cunning than simply giving away information for free. One of the spells in the tome allowed [[The Dark Star\|the Dark Star]] to transfer a small portion of its conciousness into the book. The book became [[The Necronomicon\|The Necronomicon]].

[[The Necronomicon\|The Necronomicon]] sent itself into another Realm. With this book, the spells would allow a Mortal to hurt or perhaps kill Immortals. This Necronomicon fell into the hands of powerful Aberrant creatures from [[The Realm of Water\|The Realm of Water]], Aboleths. The Aboleths, mad with power from [[The Dark Star\|the Dark Star]], waged war against the Immortals. 

After a long battle, the Aboleths were vanquished, and [[The Necronomicon\|The Necronomicon]] was locked deep away within the Material Plane, so hopefully none would discover it. The Wise One learned, for perhaps the first time, that some knowledge may better be left unknown.
