Numerous scattered island and an archipelago to the east of Aglarion form the Isle of Half-Dragons, Xantharos. The Isle is formed from the remains of [[Xantharos, the All-Dragon\|Xantharos, the All-Dragon]]. Xantharos was one of the two Original fey-dragons. [[Xantharos, the All-Dragon\|Xantharos, the All-Dragon]] reigned over the feywild until he was banished to the [[Material Plane\|Material Plane]] by [[Faeryl Myrryn\|Faeryl Myrryn]], a powerful Drow Vampire Conjurer. 

[[Xantharos, the All-Dragon\|Xantharos, the All-Dragon]] was thrust into a broken and ruined [[Aglarion\|Aglarion]]. He immediately did battle with the Dark Star. [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]] and its [[The Dark Angels\|Angelic Forces]] won after a short, but extremely bloody struggle and reduced the [[Xantharos, the All-Dragon\|All-Dragon]] to a mere corpse. The [[Xantharos, the All-Dragon\|All-Dragon]] fell into the sea, and its corpse formed into the geography as centuries passed. The immense draconic energy of the [[Xantharos, the All-Dragon\|All-Dragon]] began to transform the inhabitants into Half-Dragons, Dragonborn, and Kobolds. 

These draconic inhabitants would then enslave anyone who didn't share their draconic blood. They'd form clans where they'd only mate with drakes of their same color. They'd form large families, with about 5 to 10 slaves for each family. These large families then elected leaders to represent their color in a meeting called the Gathering of the True. These meetings are overseen by two Masters who make decisions in unison. The current masters are [[Lord Zhoulann Franklyn\|Lord Zhoulann Franklyn]] and [[Lady Yryll Wyltres\|Lady Yryll Wyltres]]. 

The citizens of the Isle are ones of slow, wise, calculated decision. Their society exhibits emotionless cruelty and paramount law. There are few inhabitants of the isle, and they live long and comfortable lives where they can train themselves in specific skills. Many inhabitants of the Isle display advanced and prodigious abilities. 

Visitors to the Isle are allowed, but they must have a good reason, and their stays are usually very short. People are only allowed to settle on the Isle if they exhibit great skill in an area of expertise useful to the people of the Isle.
