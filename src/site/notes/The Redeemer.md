A trusting and loving figure. The Redeemer is very caring of every mortal, and by far enjoys them far more than any other God. However, they can get a bit tunnel-visioned.

During the early days of the earth, the Redeemer imbued each creature with a divine spark, a shard of its own soul. Yet, all the same they were doomed to die. This filled the Redeemer with contempt for their counterpart, [[The Inevitable\|The Inevitable]]. He descended down to the [[Hel\|Hel]] that [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]] lived within. 

He demanded that he explain why he took every mortal from them. [[The Inevitable\|The Inevitable]] only answered that the Eternal Cycle must be upheld. All that begins, ends. In order to prove this fact, [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]] gave the Redeemer a dying beetle. The beetle grew strong when embraced by the Redeemer. 

"If you can keep that beetle alive for a millennia, I shall never take another mortal from your grasp ever again." 

The Redeemer thought this was child's play. Yet, the Redeemer, in their mad quest to keep this beetle alive, neglected the Material Plane. Plagues consumed the lands, plants and crops died. When the Redeemer saw, they only had but a year left to keep the Beetle alive. 

However, if they were to keep their challenge, all of the mortals would be dead already. Accepting defeat, the Redeemer sought to the Material Plane, and [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]] claimed the soul of the beetle. However, born from the corpse of the beetle was a single, small sapling. 

The Redeemer saw how life could be born from death. The Eternal Cycle [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]] spoke of. And such, the Redeemer accepts the purpose of [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]], and they see the harmony that must be upkept.

The Beetle now represents the cycle of Life and Death throughout all of time.
