[[The Gods\|Goddess]] of Darkness. When mankind was created, she thought the mortal life was undeserving of gifts from the Gods, they were beneath them.

The Writhing Darkness despised creation, so she decided to play an evil trick. She separated from [[The Shining Light\|the Shining Light]], and went to find [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]]. The Writhing Darkness offered a way for mortals to escape from the clutches of [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]]. She had created a prison in the guise of a seed. When [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]] cultivated the seed, the shadowy tendrils and branches imprisoned [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]] within the Shadowfell. 

The Writhing Darkness watched in glee as life came to a halt. People continued to die, until everything was nearly extinct. [[The Inevitable\|The Inevitable]] knew something was amiss, so he prevented anyone from dying until he could find [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]]. [[The Inevitable\|The Inevitable]] questioned the trickster furiously, but the Writhing Darkness wouldn't give up its secret. So [[The Inevitable\|the Inevitable]] threatened to never kill any of the mortals, and thus they would become Immortals by technicality. The Writhing Darkness hated the thought and reluctantly gave up its hiding spot for [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]].

The Writhing Darkness was punished by imprisonment within the Shadowfell for a century. However, this was nothing more than a slap on the wrist in the long run. The tricks would grow much more sinister.
