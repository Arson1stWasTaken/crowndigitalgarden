Royalty - The immediate Royal Family. They hold absolute power over everything within the kingdom. 

Nobles - Those who have been granted a nobility status by Royalty. They aid the Royalty in times of need, and are usually already wealthy and popular prior to their status.

The Noble Families Include:
- [[House Ronul\|House Ronul]]
- [[House Nangrath\|House Nangrath]]
- [[House Monder\|House Monder]]
- [[House Gorso\|House Gorso]]
- [[House Karramosa\|House Karramosa]]
- [[House Domiren\|House Domiren]]
- [[House Goldtooth\|House Goldtooth]]
- [[House Wyltammer\|House Wyltammer]]

Guilds - Important Staff for the Three Major Guilds of [[Aglarion\|Aglarion]] (The Crafters, The Providers, and The Merchants). They manage taxes and guild fees, and they pay these expenses directly to the Royal Treasury. They also manage laws and can create laws within their guild to be followed. These officials are elected once every 5 years. 

Clergy - Priests and High-Ranking Clerics who are seen as sources of support. They supply food, healing and shelter in times of crisis. Some still doubt them and distrust them due to their powerful arcane abilities. However, despite this, most Clerics (save for worshippers of the Equilibrium) are treated with great respect in public. 

Commoners - Anyone who isn't in any of the above classes. The commoners provide everything to the Crown. They provide the resources and labor. The [[Aglarion\|Aglarion]] law is deeply set in protecting the rights of its citizens given its history with oppression. Almost every commoner lives a respectable lifestyle, and those who don't are typically cared for and upheld by Clerics of the Redeemer.
