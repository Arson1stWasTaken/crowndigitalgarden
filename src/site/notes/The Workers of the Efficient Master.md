[[The Gods\|The God]] of Competence. Clerics who believe in their own abilities as Man worship him. They encourage themselves and others to train to their utmost limits. They use their trained skills to create, excel and accomplish great things. Clerics of this faith rarely use magic, instead choosing to rely on their skills. They only use Magic in the most dire of circumstances. Clerics of this faith care not if your skill is used for good or evil, but rather that it is honed to its limit. 

Some Clerics twist the teachings of [[The Efficient Master\|The Efficient Master]] into using their skills to advance their agendas and instead put others down. They lie, trick and steal to gain more power. Some fanatics instead abandon magic altogether, and loathe those who use it as their sworn enemies in the world.
