The Queen's Grace Orphanage, funded by the Royal Family was established a little over a century ago to assist young orphaned ladies. [[Lady Thuila\|Lady Thuila]], the headmistress was elected then. The drow headmistress trains women who end up in the Orphanage to become perfect housewives for the rich and nobles. They are extremely trained in various arts like crafting, diplomacy, negotiation, deception, persuasion, and social skills. They forge a ruthless sisterhood and there are rumors that they gather to organize a group of revolutionizing women known as the "Ringmaidens". All women who attended the Orphanage wear a simple iron ring with two overlapping circles engraved into it.
