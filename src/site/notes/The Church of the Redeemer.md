[[The Gods\|The God]] of Life. Clerics who worship [[The Redeemer\|The Redeemer]] seek to protect life, as they believe everything living bears their Lord's essence. Many of his temples are open to everyone, granting food and shelter. Clerics of his domain freely offer their healing services and resources should the recipient agree to help around a bit afterwards. 

However, some Clerics who blaspheme against [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]] believe that creation is a right given to them by [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]]. They craft horrific spawn that are unnatural, seeking immoral perfection. Others steal life from other creatures, achieving eternal life.
