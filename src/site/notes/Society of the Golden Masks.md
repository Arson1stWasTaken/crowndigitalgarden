The illusive Golden Mask society is the only true criminal organization within [[Aglarion\|Aglarion]]. They have an extensive network of informants and agents across the kingdom. Their guild is led by a secretive group of shapechangers who operate it from behind the scenes. These shapechangers use their abilities to evade the [[Red Cloaked Lawbringers\|Red Cloaks]]. The Golden Masks take part in non-lethal crimes such as smuggling, thefts, racketerring, money lendering, information brokering, or espionage. They usually avoid dirty work unless its done by mercenaries, and they don't waste their time with petty crimes to avoid unnecessary attention.
