[[The Gods\|The God]] of Knowledge. Clerics of this faith live to experience as many things as possible, learn as many things as possible. They are well versed in plenty of studies, but many try to specialize in a field of study none of their brethren have taken. The clergy organizes free classes which people are invited to attend, so they may spread the gift of knowledge. These clerics see keeping information to themselves as the greatest of all sins, so they share information freely, refraining from lying, withholding, or obscuring anything.

Some Clerics of [[The Wise One\|The Wise One]] form smaller groups, and instead they seek forbidden knowledge. These Clerics believe that each is to find information on their own, and those who do will ascend to the side of their God. These Clerics withhold as much information as they can, unless it is common knowledge.
