A gentle and caring goddess, but she is defined by her catastrophic mood swings.

When the world began, she carved the mountains and grew the forests. However, the Trickster Goddess, the Writhing Dark went about its usual bouts. It had separated from [[The Shining Light\|the Shining Light]], and sowed chaos within the Material Plane. The Writhing Dark had caused all of the vegetation to rot and wither away.

When the Eternal Mother saw her work defiled, she flew into a rage. She scorched the earth with flame and lightning. Her elemental anger knew no bound, and she ravaged her creation searching for the trickster. She found him, but the Trickster played yet another trick. He called to her: "If I can best you in combat... then you shall hand half of your creation to me." The Goddess chuckled. Even though the Trickster was a Goddess of great power, her might couldn't hold a candle to elemental power that was the Eternal Mother's. Yet, the Trickster hid in the shadows, for years, decades. She would mock and ridicule the Eternal Mother until she gave up. 

From her half of the deal, [[The Writhing Darkness\|the Writhing Darkness]] tore it from the Material Plane, and created a new plane, the Shadowfell. A realm crafted as an echo, but made of pure dark. A realm where [[The Writhing Darkness\|the Writhing Darkness]] reigned supreme.
