After the fall of the Dark Star, a handful of family clans fled into the mountains. They formed a small confederacy, and they kept the Order of Eternal Light at bay for centuries. Having been exposed to the eldritch might of the Dark Star and the arcane powers of the Order, the Vordani despise any and all users of magic. They only tolerate anti-magic. 

As time passed, the Vordani developed into a somewhat barbaric, and atheistic society. The Vordani are hard-workers who rely on their own skills and abilities, and they see magic as unstable and untrustworthy. Members of the Vordani face the afterlife as if they simply cease to exist rather than anything esoteric. They live each day as if it could be their last, filling the day with meaningful tasks and challenging themselves. The Vordani are led by family ties, where they choose a suitable leader based on previous proven value. 

Since the Vordani heavily outlawed magic, they rely on technology. Their technology is very advanced, they have experience with traps, war-gear, and war machines. They also excelled in the domestication of the ferocious mountain beasts, like Mountain Panthers or Giant Goats.

The Vordani allow slavery, and owning slaves is seen as a symbol of status. The number of slaves a Vordani citizen owns is seen as a measure of their wealth in the outside world. Vordani slaves are typically used for house tasks, chores, menial tasks, or sometimes even sex. Slaves are either captured outsiders or prisoners of war. All Vordani slaves are branded with the mark of their owner upon their foreheads. 

The current King of Vordan is a man by the name of [[King Ralukkar Doomhammer IV\|King Ralukkar Doomhammer IV]].
