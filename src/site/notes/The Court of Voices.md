So that no class may have more influence than any other, rather than those in power being able to propose policies and new ideas to the royal family, they elect 12 delegates, 3 from each social class.

These delegates are selected by a communal vote of their social class, and then they represent them. They each present problems to the Royals, and can personally converse with them. They meet with the Royal Family on the 1st of each month.
