A skilled craftsman. He keeps to himself mostly, working away in his forge for decades at a time. His gift to the mortals was simple, yet priceless. A simple flame. From it, they learned to hunt, cook, forge, and all other manner of things.

After the fall of [[The Dark Star\|the Dark Star]], Life's Evolution began to interest the Master. He would craft weapons, and bestow them upon the mortals. Their ingenuity intrigued him. They would be able to replicate his work, crudely of course, but they were able to in a frighteningly short time. The Master grew to adore the mortals. He wished to mimic [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]]'s work.

So, he spent decades upon decades in his forge. He had done it. He crafted the first Warforged. An automaton, but through careful study of [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]]'s work, it could feel, think, and love. It was the best invention of the Efficient Master to date. He would never forsake them, and he continues to watch our plane, looking for new inspiration for an invention.
