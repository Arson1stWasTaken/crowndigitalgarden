The Wondermaker is a whimsical being. The Wondermaker granted the most wild form of magic to the mortals, pure uncontrolled power.

However, the Wondermaker is a prideful being. He, [[The Eternal Mother\|The Eternal Mother]], and [[The Efficient Master\|The Efficient Master]] got into an argument. They decided to settle their dispute over who could weave the most exquisite net.

[[The Eternal Mother\|The Eternal Mother]] taught the spiders of [[The Redeemer\|The Redeemer]] to spin silk, and she then cooperated with them to create an awe-inspiring silk net.

[[The Efficient Master\|The Efficient Master]] forged an extremely effective net of golden wires which could catch any creature with ease.

However, the Wondermaker showed up with nothing. The rest of [[The Gods\|The Gods]] were confused, but then the Wondermaker showed them [[The Weave\|The Weave]]. An enigmatic, majestic creation. It harnessed every intricacy of magic, and it no doubt put both [[The Eternal Mother\|The Eternal Mother]] and [[The Efficient Master\|The Efficient Master]] to shame. 

However, [[The Eternal Mother\|The Eternal Mother]] was bitter. She continues to poison the minds of spiders, having them weave a silk net, larger, and larger, and ever larger, until one day she can surpass even the beauty of [[The Weave\|The Weave]].
