When the Dark Star's reign began, she sent her Dark Angels in search of slaves. The Dark Angels found easy targets in the form of primitive tribes. 

The Dark Angels cultivated their slaves, and bred furiously with them to create powerful Aasimar descendants. These descendants inherited the ashen hair and fiery eyes of their ancestors, and especially their cold and cynic hearts. They either worship the Dark Angels without question due to religious precedent, or by respect for their lineage. Atop the Ziggurat, the Archpriest of their society Cadmael Flesner continously performs ritual sacrifice in an attempt to resummon the Dark Star to the material plane.

The inhabitants of the Ziggurat City are still relatively low-technology, and they are surrounded by a range of treacherous mountains, making their society nearly impossible to reach. Any who have passed these mountains is never heard from again, nobody has made it into the city of these dark celestials and returned to tell the tale.
