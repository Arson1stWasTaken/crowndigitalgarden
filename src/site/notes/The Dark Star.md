[[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]] had hatched a plan. From fragments of stolen brilliance from [[The Shining Light\|the Shining Light]], in the form of the stars it had created, [[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]] absorbed their light to assume a new, much more powerful form. It had become The Dark Star.

The Dark Star outmatched any of [[The Gods\|The Gods]] in terms of power, but it was still no match for all of them combined. So, The Dark Star hatched a plan to give itself the upper hand. [[The Gods\|The Gods]] gain or lose power depending on how many worshippers they have, so the Dark Star descended upon the [[Material Plane\|Material Plane]]. It began a tyrannical reign, attempting to starve the other [[The Gods\|Gods]] of worship so that it would be able to best them in combat.
