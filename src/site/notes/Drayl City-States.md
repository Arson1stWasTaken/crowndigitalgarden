The seperationist southern peoples were rebuilding following the banishment of the Dark Star, but the Order of Eternal Light attempted to move into their territory and conquer them. These hostile invasions forced the southern peoples to unite under one general, [[Kalaman Drayl\|Kalaman Drayl]], who was the first king of this new union. 

Drayl is similar to Aglarion. It is orderly and prosperous. Drayl is a well-respected ally of Aglarion and does trade with Aglarion regularly. 

Since they were united, they managed to keep the Order of Eternal Light from conquering their lands, and they agreed to keep the city states as they were, independent yet allied, to respect their seperationist policies. 

The City States are as follows:

- [[Kostryl\|Kostryl]]
- [[Brinecoast\|Brinecoast]]
- [[Highmoor\|Highmoor]]
- [[Gynleah\|Gynleah]]
- [[Zammastra\|Zammastra]]
- [[Domain of the Sovereign\|Domain of the Sovereign]]
- [[Zolt\|Zolt]]
- [[Ysmarys\|Ysmarys]]
- [[Yellowkeep\|Yellowkeep]]
