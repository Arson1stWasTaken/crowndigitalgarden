All humanoid races are treated as equals in the kingdom of [[Aglarion\|Aglarion]]. It has become home to all who wish to live together in peace. Every race includes members who find this hard, but these individuals are mostly rejected because of their deeds and not their heritages. Each race fits into society slightly differently due to their natural capabilities and traits, and most of them can be found in all levels of society. Some are fewer in number like elves, some appear only in tales or mysteries like the grimlocks, some simply live deep underground like the duergar, or are water-bound like the sahuagin, but none of them are predestined by their alignment at birth. There are dominantly evil or good races or some communities organized around a single ancestry, but most beings live mixed in the kingdom, especially in the capital city of [[Onadbyr\|Onadbyr]]. This level of tolerance has always been so, but it has been even more pronounced since [[Queen Linolu\|Queen Linolu]] and for the past decade, as the kingdom has started to flourish under [[King Waldrann\|King Waldrann]] and his new wife [[Queen Lyrencia\|Queen Lyrencia]].
