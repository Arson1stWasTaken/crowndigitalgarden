The streets of Aglarion are kept safe by soldiers of the Royal Army and forces of local nobles. These soldiers can alert Red Cloaks, and will attempt to get the situation under control until a Red Cloaked Lawbringer can arrive at the scene.

Calling for a guard can be done so just by shouting for one. Any guard possesses means to contact a nearby Red Cloaked Lawbringer, although the further from Onadbyr, the less likely one will be available.
