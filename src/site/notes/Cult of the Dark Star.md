Those who followed the Malevolent Deity known as [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]], born from [[The Writhing Darkness\|The Writhing Darkness]]. They'd trade people, loved ones, even their own souls for power to [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]]. They lack moral compass, and seek only the betterment of themselves and the destruction of their enemies.

During its [[Age of the Dark Angels\|reign]], it would grant all of its worshippers immense power. Some of the most loyal it would even promote into empowered [[The Dark Angels\|Dark Angels]]. 

After [[The Age of Brightness\|the fall]] of [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]], the cultists were slaughtered, and very few survived. The ones that did seek a method to free their Goddess from her eternal binds, so that she may descend upon the Material Plane once more.
