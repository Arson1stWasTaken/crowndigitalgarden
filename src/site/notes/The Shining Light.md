[[The Gods\|Goddess]] of Light. When all was created, she would sacrifice fragments of her brilliance to create great stars, and would bless all light with protective power. She deeply wished for mortals to engage in virtue and prosper.

The Shining Light saw the chaos that her sister was bringing upon the [[Material Plane\|Material Plane]] in the form of [[The Dark Star\|The Dark Star]], so she asked [[The Redeemer\|the Redeemer]] to craft a vessel capable of harnessing her radiance. [[The Redeemer\|The Redeemer]] crafted a most exquisite vessel, [[Sarath\|Sarath]], which would be capable of using a portion of the divine power of the Shining Light and exemplifying the perfect mortal that she envisioned.

The Shining Light has never directly interfered in the [[Material Plane\|Material Plane]], instead opting to use vessels or divine miracles.
